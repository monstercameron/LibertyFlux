//! The verified rewrites under test, compiled from their tracked files.
//!
//! Each file is included unchanged and sees this crate as `lf_checker_rt`
//! (32-bit target only). The include paths run from this crate up to the
//! repository root, then `rewrites/verified/functions/`. Fourteen of the
//! thirty-one family files are included: the proof set (see the lifted
//! registry for the rest).

// Byte-identical verified files; their style is not linted here.
