/// Forwards one script argument (a boolean flag) to the engine. The flag is coerced with `arg != 0`.

/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching.
/// No return slot is written.
