// original: 0x00bb8ad0 DROP_OBJECT
/// Script native `DROP_OBJECT` (hash 0x24C45D0D).
///
/// Forwards an object handle and a boolean flag (`arg != 0`) to the engine.
/// No return slot is written.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred). The rewrite passes the clean 0/1 flag; the pushed
/// word carries context-pointer high bytes on the original side, so
/// the contract skips that call argument (v2 has no low-byte compare).
