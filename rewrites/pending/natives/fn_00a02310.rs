// original: 0x00a02310 WINCH_CAN_PICK_OBJECT_UP
/// Script native `WINCH_CAN_PICK_OBJECT_UP` (hash 0x73246FC0).
///
/// Forwards two script arguments (a vehicle handle and a boolean flag) to
/// the engine. The flag is coerced with `arg != 0`. No return slot is
/// written.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The full dword is reproduced here
/// for bit-exact outgoing-call matching.
