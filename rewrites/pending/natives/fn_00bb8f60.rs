/// Forwards two script arguments to the engine: a character handle and a
/// boolean flag coerced with `arg != 0`. No return slot is written.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching.
