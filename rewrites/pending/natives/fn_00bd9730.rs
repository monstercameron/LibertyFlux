/// Script native `STOP_SYNCING_SCRIPT_ANIMATIONS`.

/// Forwards one script argument (a boolean flag) to the engine, coerced
/// with `arg != 0`.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching. No return slot is written.
/// v2 port: the rewrite pushes the bare 0/1 flag; the high-byte slot residue is masked in the contract (call_skip).
