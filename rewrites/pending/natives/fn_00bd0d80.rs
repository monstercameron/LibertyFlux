// original: 0x00bd0d80 DISABLE_STICKY_BOMB_ACTIVE_SOUND
/// Script native `DISABLE_STICKY_BOMB_ACTIVE_SOUND` (hash 0x0C2D2CC5).
///
/// Forwards two script arguments (a handle and a boolean flag) to the
/// engine. The flag is coerced with `arg != 0`.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching. No return slot is written.
