// original: 0x00bd94b0 SET_PED_STOP_CLONING
/// Script native `SET_PED_STOP_CLONING` (hash 0x74C55395).
///
/// Forwards two script arguments (a character handle and a boolean flag) to
/// the engine. The flag is coerced with `arg != 0`.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching. No return slot is written.
