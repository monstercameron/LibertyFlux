// original: 0x00bc77e0 SET_CAR_STAY_IN_FAST_LANE
/// Script native `SET_CAR_STAY_IN_FAST_LANE` (hash 0x5EAD47E8).
///
/// Forwards two script arguments to the engine: a vehicle handle and a
/// boolean flag coerced with `arg != 0`. No return slot is written.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching.
