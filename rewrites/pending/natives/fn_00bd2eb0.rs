//! Script call context: the handler receives one pointer. At +0 sits the
//! result-slot pointer where a return value is stored, at +8 the argument
//! array. The handler forwards the arguments to one engine routine and, for
//! natives with a return value, stores the answer in the result slot.
/// Call context handed to a native handler by the script VM.

///
/// Handler behaviour: reads 1 argument word from the call context,
/// forwards slot 0 (raw word) to the engine routine, and returns nothing to the script.
///
/// The declared `u32` return is the observed exit value of `eax` (the
/// engine answer, left in place); the script VM ignores it.
