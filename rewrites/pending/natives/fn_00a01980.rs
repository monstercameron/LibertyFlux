// original: 0x00a01980 ROTATE_OBJECT
/// Script native `ROTATE_OBJECT` (hash 0x12B524B7).
///
/// Rotates an object: forwards an object handle, two float bit-patterns
/// (angles) and a boolean flag coerced with `arg != 0`, then stores
/// the low byte of the engine answer (zero-extended) into the return slot.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching.
