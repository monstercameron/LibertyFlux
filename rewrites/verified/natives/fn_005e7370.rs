/// Forwards one boolean script argument (coerced with `arg != 0`) to the
/// engine. No return slot is written.
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the rewrite passes the plain 0/1 flag and the contract masks
/// this call argument (`call_skip`); only the low byte is meaningful.
