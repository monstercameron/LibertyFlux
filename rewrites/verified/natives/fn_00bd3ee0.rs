/// Forwards one boolean script argument to the engine, coerced with `arg != 0`. No return slot is written.
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred). The rewrite passes the clean 0/1 flag; the pushed
/// word carries context-pointer high bytes on the original side, so
/// the contract skips that call argument (v2 has no low-byte compare).
