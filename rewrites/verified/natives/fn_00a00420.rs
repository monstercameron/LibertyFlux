// original: 0x00a00420 ANCHOR_OBJECT
/// Script native `ANCHOR_OBJECT` (hash 0x5785181B).
///
/// Forwards three script arguments (an object handle, a boolean flag and a
/// float bit-pattern) to the engine. The flag is coerced with `arg != 0`.
///
/// Quirk (observed): the handler coerces the flag into the low byte of its
/// own incoming stack slot and pushes the whole dword, so the pushed word's
/// high bytes repeat the context pointer. The engine reads only the low
/// byte (Inferred); the full dword is reproduced here for bit-exact
/// outgoing-call matching. No return slot is written.
